# Comp Chess

Comp Chess is not a normal chess website. In normal websites like chess.com, only you and maybe another player care about the match that you are playing. This takes away from the benefits of a multiplayer experience because only two players really care about a single chess match. In Comp Chess, there is only one pvp chess game playing at a time and it is visible to all other players. This makes every chess game exciting and important as there is a lot of pressure to win from everyone who is watching and commenting and you don't want to lose in front of everyone. The target audience for this game is the current chess audience.

The user experience would be pretty straightforward. When the user goes to the website, they will see a chat, leaderboard, and the current match that is being played. To play a match, the user must queue up and wait in a queue to play. The user experience is pretty similar to websites like chess.com, but there is room for improvement with better animations when playing, like the pieces being pushed over, exploding, etc.

Players love competitive elements in games. In this game, there will be a leaderboard so players can grind to get better. The leaderboards will reset weekly or monthly, so players have to come back and play to keep their positions on the leaderboards.

If we wanted to expand on this idea, we could add AI to play against and leaderboards for those ai, cosmetics to give players an option to stand out ($$$), tournaments to compete for prizes, and betting on matches.

If we wanted to monetize this idea, we could charge for cosmetics (board, pieces, or animations) and a premium queue pass to speed up the queue.

Accessibility and Inclusivity: Just play the game
