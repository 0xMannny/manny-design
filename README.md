# Comp Chess

Comp Chess is not a normal chess website. With normal websites like chess.com, it focuses mainly on you and maybe another player. This takes away from the benefits of a multiplayer experience because only two players really care about a single chess match. In Comp Chess, there is only one pvp chess game playing at a time and it is visible to all other players. This makes every chess game exciting and important as there is a lot of pressure to win from everyone who is watching and commenting and you don't want to lose in front of everyone. The target audience for this game is the current chess audience.

The user experince would be pretty simple. When the user goes to the website, they will see a chat, leaderboard, and the current match that is being played. To play a match, the user must queue up and wait in queue to play. The user experience is pretty similiar to website like chess.com, but there is room for improvemt with better animations when playing, like the pieces being pushed over, exploding, etc.

Players love competive elements in games. In this game, there will be a leaderboard so players can grind to get better. Also, the leaderboards will reset weekly or monthly, so players have to come back and play to stay on the leaderboards.

If we wanted to expand on this idea, we could add ai to play against and leaderboards for those ai, comestics to give players an option to stand out ($$$), tournements to compete for prizes, and betting on matches.

If we wanted to monetize this idea, we could charge for comestics (board, pieces, or animations) and a premium queue pass to speed up queue.

Accessibility and Inclusivity: Just play the game
